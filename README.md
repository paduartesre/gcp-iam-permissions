# Terraform IAM Management for Google Cloud

This repository contains a Terraform solution for managing Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions for user groups in a Google Cloud Project. The IAM roles are applied to user groups for specific resources like Google Cloud Storage (GCS) buckets, audit logs, and Google Compute Engine (GCE) instances. The state of the Terraform resources is stored in a remote backend on Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

## Structure

The solution is structured in the following manner:

1. A Terraform module named `iam` is created under the `modules` directory. This module is responsible for creating and managing IAM bindings for a given IAM role and members in a Google Cloud Project.

2. The root module (`main.tf`) utilizes the `iam` module to create IAM bindings for three different scenarios:
   - For user groups that require read-only permissions on GCS buckets.
   - For user groups that require read-only permissions on audit logs.
   - For user groups that require permissions to create, update, and delete GCE instances.

3. The variables required by the root module and the `iam` module are defined in `variables.tf`.

4. The outputs from the root module are defined in `outputs.tf`.

5. The specific values for the variables used by the root module are defined in `terraform.tfvars`.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Update the `terraform.tfvars` file with the appropriate values for your Google Cloud project and user groups.

3. Initialize the Terraform workspace:

```bash
terraform init
```

4. Verify the changes that will be made by Terraform:

```bash
terraform plan
```

5. If the plan looks correct, apply the changes:

```bash
terraform apply
```

6. Confirm the changes by typing `yes` when prompted.

7. After `terraform apply` finishes, it will output the IAM bindings for the user groups. You can also view these outputs at any time by running:

```bash
terraform output
```

## Security

This solution uses a remote backend on GCS to store the Terraform state. This ensures that the state is stored in a centralized and secure location, and allows for state locking to prevent concurrent modification of resources. 

Make sure that access to the GCS bucket used for storing the Terraform state is properly secured, and that the credentials used to access the bucket are securely stored.

Remember to always follow the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) when assigning IAM roles to user groups. Only assign the minimal permissions that a group needs to perform its tasks.
